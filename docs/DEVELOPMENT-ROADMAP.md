## Telemetry Implementation Phases

The telemetry system follows its own 4-phase implementation within the larger timeline:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ (Week 1, Days 1-2)
- [x] CircularBuffer implementation
- [x] Property-based tests
- [x] Performance characterization
- [ ] Aggregation logic (Day 3)

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization (Week 1, Days 3-4)
- [ ] Web Worker setup
- [ ] LTTB downsampling algorithm
- [ ] Canvas-based charts
- [ ] Batch update optimization

### Phase 3: Persistence & Sync (Week 2)
- [ ] Dexie/IndexedDB integration
- [ ] Background sync
- [ ] Offline queue
- [ ] Conflict resolution

### Phase 4: Testing & Hardening (Week 3)
- [ ] Load testing (100+ sensors)
- [ ] Memory profiling
- [ ] Network failure simulation
- [ ] Field device testing

## Next Immediate Steps (Day 3)

### Morning (2-3 hours)
1. Complete telemetry aggregation logic
   - 1-second aggregates (min/max/avg)
   - Test with high-frequency data
   - Reference: [Telemetry Guide](./telemetry-comprehensive-guide.md#data-aggregation-strategy)

2. Set up Web Worker
   - Basic message passing
   - Move aggregation off main thread
   - Performance monitoring

### Afternoon (3-4 hours)
1. WebSocket Manager Implementation
   - Connection establishment
   - Reconnection logic with exponential backoff
   - Message queuing during disconnection
   - Heartbeat/ping-pong system

2. Integration Testing
   - End-to-end data flow test
   - Memory usage verification
   - Performance benchmarking

## Critical Path Items

These items block other work and must be prioritized:

1. **WebSocket Resilience** (Day 3)
   - Blocks: All real-time features
   - Risk: Field network instability

2. **Memory-Safe Data Structures** (‚úÖ Complete)
   - Blocks: Long-running stability
   - Risk: Tablet crashes

3. **Offline Queue** (Week 2)
   - Blocks: Field deployment
   - Risk: Data loss during outages

4. **Performance Monitoring** (Day 3)
   - Blocks: Optimization work
   - Risk: Regression detection

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Real-time telemetry data flowing
- [ ] PWA installable and offline-capable
- [ ] Core UI components rendering
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Memory usage <50MB

### MVP Completion Criteria
- [ ] 60fps UI during updates
- [ ] <2 second alert latency
- [ ] 24-hour stability verified
- [ ] Offline mode fully functional
- [ ] Field device tested

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| WebSocket complexity | High | Start simple, iterate | Active |
| Low-end tablet performance | High | Test on hardware early | Planned |
| 2G network latency | Medium | Aggressive data aggregation | Planned |
| Battery drain | Medium | Optimize polling, dark mode | Planned |
