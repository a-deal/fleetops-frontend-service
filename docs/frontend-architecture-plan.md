## Best Practices for Enterprise Frontend Development (2025)

### Scalable Architecture
- **Component-Driven Development (CDD)**: Build UIs from the bottom up with tools like Storybook
- **Modular Codebase (Feature Slicing)**: Organize by feature rather than file type
- **Strict Typing**: TypeScript with strict mode enabled

### Maintainability & Developer Experience
- **Automated Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint with pre-commit hooks (Husky)
- **Robust Testing Strategy**:
  - Unit/Integration: Vitest or Jest with React Testing Library
  - End-to-End: Playwright or Cypress
- **Centralized API Layer**: Dedicated module for all API interactions

### Performance & Security
- **Aggressive Code Splitting**: Route-based and component-level splitting
- **Observability**: Error tracking (Sentry, Datadog) and analytics from day one
- **Dependency Management**: Regular audits with npm audit or Snyk/Dependabot

## Technology Evaluation

### Next.js vs Plain React+Vite
**Recommendation**: Next.js
- **Why**: SEO requirements for public-facing gym discovery pages
- **Benefits**: SSR/SSG/ISR capabilities, file-based routing, integrated optimizations
- **Trade-off**: More opinionated than plain Vite setup

### Tailwind CSS v4 Decision (January 2025)
- **Current Status**: Production ready with 95%+ plugin compatibility
- **Performance**: 5x faster full builds, 100x faster incremental builds
- **Decision**: Direct v4 adoption to avoid migration complexity
- **Benefits**: Native CSS variables, smaller bundles, better DX from day one

### State Management Strategy
```typescript
// Global State (Zustand)
- User preferences
- UI state (sidebar, modals)
- Cached filters

// Server State (TanStack Query)
- API data
- Real-time metrics
- User data

// Local State (useState/useReducer)
- Form inputs
- Component-specific UI
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

1. **Code Splitting**
   - Route-based splitting by default with Next.js
   - Component-level splitting for heavy visualizations
   - Dynamic imports for third-party libraries

2. **Data Management**
   - Implement cursor-based pagination
   - Use virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Cache API responses with TanStack Query
   - Implement optimistic updates

3. **Asset Optimization**
   - Use Next.js Image component
   - Implement progressive image loading
   - Lazy load non-critical components
   - Use SVGs for icons

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Use WebSockets for live data
   - Implement selective subscriptions
   - Batch updates to prevent re-renders
   - Use React.memo strategically

## Risk Mitigation Plan

1. **Timeline Buffers**
   - Built-in 4-week buffer across phases
   - Weekly sprint reviews to catch delays early
   - Clear MVP vs post-MVP feature delineation

2. **Technology Risks**
   - ECharts validation in Week 1 (fallback: Chart.js)
   - Tailwind v4 plugin validation early
   - Performance benchmarks from day 1
   - Real-time requirements clarification before implementation

3. **Team Scaling**
   - Start with 3-4 senior developers
   - Add team members only after patterns established
   - Clear code ownership boundaries
   - Comprehensive onboarding documentation

4. **Complexity Management**
   - Feature flags for progressive rollout
   - Component isolation with Storybook
   - Automated testing from start
   - Regular architecture reviews
