## Week 1: Foundation

### Overview

First week focused on project setup, PWA implementation, testing infrastructure, and beginning telemetry development. Made significant progress on foundational elements.

### Week 1 Goals (From Planning)

- ‚úÖ Project setup with Next.js 14 App Router
- ‚úÖ Implement PWA with Serwist
- ‚úÖ Configure Jest for testing
- ‚úÖ Begin telemetry CircularBuffer implementation
- ‚è≥ Complete Phase 1 telemetry (in progress)

## Day 1: Project Setup

### Date: 2025-07-05

### Accomplishments

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up Next.js 14 with App Router
   - Configured TypeScript with strict settings
   - Established folder structure

2. **Fleet Theme Implementation**
   - Created comprehensive design token system
   - Implemented industrial color palette
   - Added GT Pressura font family
   - Built status-based color system for field visibility

3. **PWA Phase 1 Implementation**
   - Integrated @serwist/next for service worker
   - Created offline fallback page
   - Configured manifest.json
   - Set up basic caching strategies

4. **Component Development**
   - Built StatusIndicator component
   - Created responsive navigation
   - Implemented fleet-themed UI components

### Technical Decisions

1. **Chose Serwist over next-pwa**
   - Better TypeScript support
   - More active maintenance
   - Cleaner API

2. **Fleet Design System**
   - Navy/orange industrial palette
   - High contrast for field conditions
   - Status-based colors (normal/warning/critical)

### Challenges Resolved

1. **Next.js App Router Compatibility**
   - Solution: Used latest @serwist/next with App Router support

2. **Font Loading Performance**
   - Solution: Subset GT Pressura for only needed characters

### Code Highlights

```typescript
// Fleet theme colors
const colors = {
  fleet: {
    navy: { DEFAULT: '#0A1929', light: '#1E3A5F' },
    orange: { DEFAULT: '#FF6B35', dark: '#CC5528' },
    gray: { 50: '#F8FAFC', 900: '#0F172A' },
  },
  status: {
    normal: '#10B981',
    warning: '#F59E0B',
    critical: '#EF4444',
  },
};
```

## Day 2: PWA & Testing

### Date: 2025-07-06

### Morning Focus: PWA Debugging

1. **PWA Issues Resolved**
   - Fixed Chrome manifest recognition (added PNG icons)
   - Implemented dynamic cache versioning
   - Resolved offline mode CSS loading
   - Added comprehensive offline page

2. **Root Cause Findings**
   - Chrome requires PNG icons (not just SVG) for manifest
   - Static PWA_VERSION caused stale cache issues
   - Runtime caches needed versioning

### Afternoon Focus: Testing Infrastructure

1. **Jest Configuration**
   - Set up multi-project configuration
   - Fixed TypeScript integration issues
   - Implemented property-based testing
   - Created performance characterization tests

2. **CircularBuffer Implementation**
   - Completed core data structure
   - Added comprehensive unit tests
   - Fixed edge cases (slice(-0) quirk)
   - Converted performance tests to characterization

3. **Documentation Consolidation**
   - Created testing-comprehensive-guide.md
   - Merged 4 testing documents into 1
   - Archived historical documents
   - Updated all cross-references

### Technical Solutions

1. **PWA Cache Versioning**

   ```javascript
   const getPwaVersion = () => {
     try {
       return execSync('git rev-parse --short HEAD').toString().trim();
     } catch {
       return new Date().getTime().toString();
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Jest TypeScript Fix**

   ```javascript
   projects: [
     {
       preset: 'ts-jest', // Must be in EACH project
       testEnvironment: 'node',
     },
   ];
   ```

3. **Performance Test Pattern**
   ```typescript
   // Log metrics instead of pass/fail
   console.log('Performance Characteristics:');
   measurements.forEach(({ fillLevel, avgTime }) => {
     console.log(`  Fill ${fillLevel * 100}%: ${avgTime.toFixed(4)}ms`);
   });
   // Only fail on catastrophic regression
   expect(variance).toBeLessThan(20);
   ```

### Action Items Completed

From Day 2 Action Plan:

- ‚úÖ Add PNG icons to manifest.json
- ‚úÖ Implement dynamic PWA versioning
- ‚úÖ Update runtime cache names with versions
- ‚úÖ Test offline functionality end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Fix Jest TypeScript configuration
- ‚úÖ Convert performance tests to characterization
- ‚úÖ Complete CircularBuffer implementation
- ‚úÖ Consolidate testing documentation

Additional Day 2 Accomplishments:

- ‚úÖ Implement Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit hooks
- ‚úÖ Configure staged-only fast checks (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Jest)
- ‚úÖ Set up comprehensive pre-push validation
- ‚úÖ Add JSDoc type annotation to .prettierrc.js
- ‚úÖ Document git hooks in frontend guide

## Key Decisions Log

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Testing Framework: Jest + Playwright**
   - Date: 2025-07-06
   - Rationale: Maturity over speed (vs Vitest)
   - Confidence: 8-9/10 from consensus analysis

2. **Pre-Commit Strategy: Husky + lint-staged**
   - Date: 2025-07-06
   - Rationale: Industry standard, fast staged-only checks
   - Trade-off: Build verification moved to pre-push for speed
   - Confidence: 9/10 from consensus (O4-mini, Gemini Pro, DeepSeek)

3. **State Management: Zustand**
   - Date: 2025-07-05
   - Rationale: 8KB vs Redux's 72KB, React 18 ready
   - Impact: Better performance on 2G networks

4. **Real-time: Native WebSocket**
   - Date: 2025-07-05
   - Rationale: No Socket.io overhead (saves 13KB)
   - Trade-off: More implementation work

5. **PWA Approach: Serwist**
   - Date: 2025-07-05
   - Rationale: Modern, TypeScript-first, active maintenance
   - Result: Successful implementation with versioning

### Technical Discoveries

1. **Chrome PWA Requirements**
   - Chrome DevTools requires PNG icons (192x192 minimum)
   - W3C spec allows SVG but Chrome is stricter
   - Solution: Include both PNG and SVG icons

2. **Jest Project Configuration**
   - Projects don't inherit parent preset setting
   - Each project needs explicit `preset: 'ts-jest'`
   - Separate tsconfig.test.json avoids conflicts

3. **JavaScript Quirks**
   - `array.slice(-0)` returns full array, not empty
   - Must handle n=0 case explicitly in getLast()
   - Property-based testing catches these edge cases

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Incremental Approach**
   - Small, tested pieces build confidence
   - Early PWA implementation revealed issues quickly
   - TDD with CircularBuffer prevented bugs

2. **Documentation as You Go**
   - Created implementation docs during work
   - Captured decisions and rationale immediately
   - Made consolidation easier

3. **Tool Selection**
   - Serwist was the right choice for PWA
   - Jest configuration complexity was worth it
   - Property-based testing found edge cases

### What Could Improve

1. **Testing First**
   - Should have set up Jest before implementing
   - Would have caught TypeScript issues earlier

2. **Research Browser Quirks**
   - Chrome's PNG requirement wasn't documented well
   - Could have saved debugging time

3. **Performance Expectations**
   - Initial performance test bounds were too strict
   - Characterization tests are better approach

## Upcoming Milestones

> üìç **Note**: See [Development Roadmap](./DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md) for complete timeline

### Day 3 Goals (Next)

- [ ] Complete telemetry aggregation logic (1-second aggregates)
- [ ] Implement Web Worker for processing
- [ ] Set up WebSocket manager with reconnection
- [ ] Integration testing end-to-end

### Week 2 Goals

- [ ] Complete design system (20+ components)
- [ ] Storybook documentation
- [ ] IndexedDB persistence layer
- [ ] Offline queue implementation

### Week 3 Goals

- [ ] Real-time data flow end-to-end
- [ ] Implement chart components
- [ ] Add equipment list/detail pages
- [ ] Set up Zustand stores

### Critical Path Items

1. WebSocket resilience (most critical for field ops)
2. Memory-safe data structures (prevent tablet crashes)
3. Offline queue implementation (handle network drops)
4. Performance monitoring setup (track regressions)

### Risk Mitigation

- **Risk**: WebSocket complexity underestimated
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple implementation, iterate
- **Risk**: Performance on low-end tablets
- **Mitigation**: Test on actual hardware early
