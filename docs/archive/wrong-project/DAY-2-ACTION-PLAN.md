# Day 2 Action Plan: Gym Analytics Platform
*Generated with Gemini 2.5 Pro - Living Document*

## Executive Summary
Day 2 focuses on establishing critical architectural foundations that will enable rapid, consistent development across the team. This plan emphasizes decision-making clarity, measurable outcomes, and team autonomy.

## Typography Note
**Primary Font**: GT America will be implemented as our primary typeface across all interfaces.
- Font files to be hosted locally for performance
- Fallback stack: GT America, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif
- Variable font implementation for optimal loading

---

## Phase 1: Unified Theme System (9:00-10:30)
### Objective
Create a robust theme provider that eliminates CSS conflicts between shadcn/ui and Tremor while enabling smooth dark mode transitions.

### Action Items Checklist
- [ ] Create `ThemeProvider` component wrapping both libraries
- [ ] Implement CSS variable namespace strategy
- [ ] Configure Tailwind v4 @layer directives
- [ ] Set up dark mode toggle with localStorage persistence
- [ ] Test theme switching performance (<50ms transition)
- [ ] Document theme extension patterns

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Recommendation | Rationale |
|----------|---------|----------------|-----------|
| CSS Conflict Resolution | 1. CSS Layers<br>2. Namespacing<br>3. PostCSS plugins | **CSS Layers** | Native browser support, Tailwind v4 integration |
| Theme Storage | 1. localStorage<br>2. Cookies<br>3. Database | **localStorage + Cookies** | Instant client-side, SSR support |
| Color System | 1. HSL<br>2. RGB<br>3. HEX | **HSL** | Better for dynamic theming |

### Performance Benchmarks
- Theme switch: <50ms
- Initial render with theme: No flash of unstyled content
- Bundle size increase: <2KB gzipped

---

## Phase 2: Design Token System (10:30-12:00)
### Objective
Establish a scalable design token architecture that unifies visual language across components.

### Action Items Checklist
- [ ] Define color palette (primary, secondary, accent, semantic)
- [ ] Implement GT America font with proper loading strategy
- [ ] Create spacing scale (4px base unit)
- [ ] Define shadow system (5 elevations)
- [ ] Set up border radius tokens
- [ ] Create animation timing tokens
- [ ] Generate TypeScript types for all tokens
- [ ] Build Figma token export pipeline

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Recommendation | Rationale |
|----------|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Token Format | 1. CSS Variables<br>2. JS Objects<br>3. JSON | **CSS Variables + TS** | Runtime flexibility, type safety |
| Font Loading | 1. @font-face<br>2. next/font<br>3. External CDN | **next/font** | Automatic optimization, no layout shift |
| Color Format | 1. Named colors<br>2. Numeric scale<br>3. Semantic only | **Semantic + Scale** | Balance flexibility and constraints |

### Performance Benchmarks
- Font loading: <100ms (cached)
- Token resolution: O(1) lookup time
- Type checking: Zero runtime overhead

---

## Phase 3: State Management Architecture (13:00-14:30)
### Objective
Implement a predictable, performant state management solution optimized for real-time analytics.

### Action Items Checklist
- [ ] Set up Zustand store structure
- [ ] Create typed store slices (auth, ui, preferences)
- [ ] Implement TanStack Query client configuration
- [ ] Build custom hooks for common patterns
- [ ] Set up state persistence middleware
- [ ] Create devtools integration
- [ ] Write state migration utilities
- [ ] Document state shape conventions

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Recommendation | Rationale |
|----------|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Global State Scope | 1. Minimal<br>2. Moderate<br>3. Comprehensive | **Minimal** | Server state in React Query |
| Store Structure | 1. Single store<br>2. Multiple stores<br>3. Slice pattern | **Slice pattern** | Better code splitting |
| Persistence | 1. All state<br>2. Selected slices<br>3. No persistence | **Selected slices** | Balance UX and performance |

### Performance Benchmarks
- Store update: <1ms
- Subscription overhead: <0.1ms per component
- Hydration time: <10ms
- Memory footprint: <50KB for typical session

---

## Phase 4: Mock Service Infrastructure (14:30-16:00)
### Objective
Create realistic API mocking that enables parallel frontend/backend development.

### Action Items Checklist
- [ ] Install and configure MSW 2.0
- [ ] Create base handlers for authentication
- [ ] Build gym data generators (100+ gyms)
- [ ] Implement time-series data mocking
- [ ] Add controlled error scenarios
- [ ] Set up WebSocket mock support
- [ ] Create data refresh patterns
- [ ] Build developer UI for mock control

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Recommendation | Rationale |
|----------|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Mock Data Format | 1. Static JSON<br>2. Dynamic generators<br>3. Recorded responses | **Dynamic generators** | Realistic variability |
| Error Simulation | 1. Random<br>2. Controlled<br>3. None | **Controlled** | Predictable testing |
| Performance Throttling | 1. Always on<br>2. Configurable<br>3. Production-like | **Configurable** | Development flexibility |

### Performance Benchmarks
- Mock response time: 50-200ms (configurable)
- Memory usage: <100MB for 10k records
- Generator performance: <10ms per record

## Decision Log Template
Track all architectural decisions made during implementation:

```markdown
### Decision #001: [Date]
**Context**: Brief description of the problem
**Decision**: What was decided
**Alternatives Considered**: Other options evaluated
**Rationale**: Why this choice was made
**Consequences**: Expected impact
**Review Date**: When to revisit this decision
```

---

## Continuous Monitoring
### Performance Dashboard
Track these metrics throughout the day:
- Build time trend
- Bundle size growth
- Component render performance
- Type checking speed
- Test execution time

### Team Velocity Indicators
- Components completed
- Decisions made vs. pending
- Blockers encountered
- Knowledge gaps identified

---

## Success Criteria
By end of Day 2, the team should be able to:
1. Build new components without CSS conflicts ✓
2. Toggle dark mode smoothly across all UI ✓
3. Fetch mock data with proper loading states ✓
4. Access typed global state ✓
5. Reference 5 production patterns ✓

## Risk Mitigation
- **Theme Conflicts**: Test each component in isolation first
- **State Complexity**: Start with minimal global state
- **Mock Data Realism**: Use production data shapes
- **Performance Regression**: Set up monitoring early
- **Team Confusion**: Over-document in the beginning

---

## Notes for Tomorrow (Day 3)
- Review Decision Log entries
- Measure actual vs. projected benchmarks
- Identify patterns for component factory
- Plan authentication flow implementation
- Schedule design system review with stakeholders
