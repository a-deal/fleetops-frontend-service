# Week 1 Fleet Management Platform Plan

## Overview
Week 1 establishes the fleet-aware foundation for the 10-week MVP, based on consensus recommendations from GPT-4o, Claude Opus 4, and DeepSeek. The hybrid approach ensures every architectural decision supports industrial IoT requirements from day one.

## Week 1 Goals
- ✅ Fleet-aware foundations preventing 40-50% future rework
- ✅ Real-time telemetry architecture
- ✅ PWA offline-first capabilities
- ✅ Industrial UI component library
- ✅ Mock sensor data infrastructure

## Day-by-Day Breakdown

### Day 1 (Completed) ✅
**Foundation Setup**
- Next.js 15.3.5 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 
- UI libraries (shadcn/ui, Tremor, Framer Motion)
- Project structure and tooling

### Day 2 (Fleet-Aware Foundations)
**Industrial Infrastructure**
- Fleet-aware theme system with equipment status colors
- Real-time state management (WebSocket-ready Zustand)
- Telemetry mock infrastructure (sensor data patterns)
- 5 industrial reference components

### Day 3 (PWA & Real-time Infrastructure)
**Progressive Web App Setup**
- Service worker implementation
- Offline data caching strategy
- Background sync for action items
- Push notification foundation
- WebSocket connection management
- Real-time telemetry pipeline

**Key Components**:
- Fleet Dashboard shell ("God view")
- Equipment grid layout
- Connection status management

### Day 4 (Core Fleet Features)
**Equipment Management**
- Equipment detail pages
- Telemetry visualization components
- Alert management system
- Action item workflows
- Hydraulics subsystem monitoring

**Technical Focus**:
- Time-series data handling
- Chart performance optimization
- Alert prioritization logic

### Day 5 (Integration & Polish)
**System Integration**
- Multi-tenant routing setup
- Permission system foundation
- Data persistence layer
- Performance optimization
- Mobile responsiveness

**Deliverables**:
- Working fleet dashboard
- Real-time telemetry display
- Offline capability demo
- Week 2 planning session

## Critical Success Factors

### Technical Milestones
1. **Real-time Data Flow** (Day 3)
   - WebSocket → Zustand → Components
   - <100ms update latency
   - Graceful degradation

2. **Offline Resilience** (Day 3-4)
   - Service worker caching
   - IndexedDB queue
   - Sync on reconnect

3. **Industrial UI** (Day 2-4)
   - Gauge components
   - Status indicators
   - Alert systems
   - Equipment cards

4. **Performance Targets** (Day 5)
   - 60 FPS during updates
   - <3s initial load
   - <50MB memory usage

## Risk Management

### High Priority Risks
1. **WebSocket Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with polling on Day 3
   - Upgrade path: Socket.io integration

2. **PWA Learning Curve**
   - Mitigation: Use next-pwa plugin
   - Fallback: Basic caching first

3. **Telemetry Performance**
   - Mitigation: Data windowing
   - Throttle updates to 1Hz

### Contingency Plans
- If WebSocket delayed: Use Server-Sent Events
- If PWA complex: Defer to Week 2
- If performance issues: Reduce sensor count

## Team Allocation

### Day 3 Teams
- **Team A (2 devs)**: PWA infrastructure
- **Team B (1 dev)**: Fleet dashboard
- **Team C (1 dev)**: WebSocket setup

### Day 4 Teams
- **Team A**: Equipment pages
- **Team B**: Telemetry charts
- **Team C**: Alert system

### Day 5 Teams
- **All hands**: Integration and testing

## Week 2 Preview

Based on Week 1 fleet foundations:
- Advanced telemetry features
- Predictive maintenance UI
- Map-based fleet view
- Maintenance scheduling
- Report generation

## Deliverables Checklist

### End of Week 1
- [ ] Fleet dashboard with real-time updates
- [ ] 3+ equipment detail pages
- [ ] Offline mode working
- [ ] 10+ industrial UI components
- [ ] Telemetry mock data flowing
- [ ] Alert system functional
- [ ] Action items CRUD
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Architecture Decisions Log

### WebSocket vs MQTT (Day 3)
- **Decision**: WebSocket for MVP
- **Rationale**: Simpler, native browser support
- **Upgrade Path**: MQTT in Week 6

### State Management (Day 2-3)
- **Decision**: Zustand + WebSocket middleware
- **Rationale**: Built-in subscription support
- **Alternative**: Redux + Socket.io

### PWA Strategy (Day 3)
- **Decision**: next-pwa with Workbox
- **Rationale**: Next.js integration
- **Scope**: Offline-first from start
