/**
 * PWA Utility Functions
 * 
 * Helper functions for service worker operations and PWA lifecycle management.
 * These utilities handle common tasks and error scenarios in a consistent way.
 * 
 * USER CONTEXT:
 * - Operators need clear feedback when app updates are available
 * - Errors must be logged for troubleshooting in remote locations
 * - Updates should be non-disruptive to active equipment monitoring
 * - Field techs may have limited technical knowledge
 * 
 * TECHNICAL CONTEXT:
 * - Centralizes error handling for service worker operations
 * - Provides consistent user notification patterns
 * - Future integration point for monitoring services
 * - Abstracts complex SW APIs into simple functions
 * 
 * CAUTION:
 * - Error logs may contain sensitive operational data
 * - User notifications must be clear and actionable
 * - Don't auto-update during critical operations
 */

/**
 * Handle service worker errors consistently
 * 
 * @param error - The error that occurred
 * 
 * BEHAVIOR:
 * - Logs to console in development
 * - Will send to monitoring service in production (future)
 * - Does NOT show user notifications (avoid alarm fatigue)
 */

  // Future: Store error locally for offline debugging
  // Example: logToIndexedDB(error);

/**
 * Notify user about available app updates
 * 
 * USER STORY:
 * "As a field operator, I want to know when updates are available
 * but not be forced to update during critical equipment checks"
 * 
 * FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:
 * - Show non-intrusive banner at top of screen
 * - Allow "Update Now" or "Later" options
 * - Auto-update during idle periods
